# The-Quintessential-Analyst
Being a die-hard football fan I was always intrigued by the pre and post-game analysis of matches which turned out to be mostly accurate. So I
decided to create my own match result predictor that would allow me to predict the result of football matches based on a number of factors such as
the current form of the two involved teams (previous wins, losses, and draws in 5-10 matches), home or away game, and the outcome of previous
encounters of the same teams.
The project still has a lot of scope as I plan to involve a few more factors to make it unbeatable such as the form of current players, and also make it
capable enough to track the health and fitness of the players and suggest changes to the team roster, suggest team formations that the manager can
make his players play to maximize their probability of winning the match.
I also plan to include several more features that will allow a football club to implement the system to scout for young talented players to build a strong
team in the future.
